      "text": "Haerye (解例) is a name that comes from the Hunminjeongeum Haerye, meaning “explanations and examples.” Just as King Sejong explained the principles of Hangeul with clear reasoning and examples, this app is designed to help you learn Korean through structured explanations and rich examples.",

      "step2_title": "2. Basic greetings & everyday expressions",
      "step2_desc": "Start with the most common daily phrases like “Hello,” “Thank you,” and “Sorry.” Learn key basics needed for simple conversation first—self-introductions, numbers, dates, days of the week, and more.",
      "step3_title": "3. Core vocabulary",
      "step3_desc": "Learn 300+ essential words organized by themes such as family, food, places, weather, and emotions. Each word comes with example sentences so you can understand real usage contexts.",

      "step5_title": "5. Listening & speaking practice",
      "step5_desc": "Practice understanding real-life conversations. Use TTS (text-to-speech) to repeatedly listen to words and sentences, improve pronunciation, and build speaking skills by shadowing.",

      "tools_desc": "Flashcards: Use them as a review tool throughout the course. A smart spaced-review system shows missed cards more often and familiar cards less often."
